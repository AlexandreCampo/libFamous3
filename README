===============================================================================
 For the impatients
===============================================================================

- use a recent debian based linux distribution (debian, ubuntu, mint, ...)

- install dependencies 
    > sudo apt-get install make g++ libgsl0-dev libtinyxml-dev
      libboost-program-options-dev libbullet-dev premake4 chipmunk-dev
      libopenscenegraph-dev
    
- compile with
    > premake4 gmake && make && premake4 debpackage
    
- install with
    > sudo dpkg -i libfamous-3.0.deb
    
- you're done, test demos from
  https://github.com/AlexandreCampo/famous3Simulation
  
  don't forget : press space to toggle pause and run the simulator
                 keyboard shortcuts are displayed on the terminal

 What is it ?
===============================================================================

FaMouS is a simulator initially designed to study swarm robotics.  It aims at
speed, simplicity and modularity to allow fast development and quick results in
complex scenarios with many entities.

Main concepts are the services and the objects.

Example of services include an OpenGL render and a 3d physics engine based on
bullet. There are objects such as a floor, a robot, an arena. Objects must be
designed to interact with services. To do so, they inherit from an interface
that comes with the service. If an object implements that interface, it becomes
de facto compatible with the service and it can register to it.

In addition, objects can have devices (such as sensors and actuators : motors,
infrared sensors etc...)  and any object can be assigned a controller.

A fundamental idea of FaMouS is modularity. Any object/service/device/controller
can be easily copy/pasted, modified and reused with no consequence on other
parts of the simulator (exception is changes to service interface which also
imply changes to objects implementing that interface).

The simulator itself comes as a library that you can link to your code.

We expect users to just create directories in which they throw new services /
objects / devices / controllers adapted from existing sources. If some material
is frequently reused, we will promote it and integrate it in the core of the
simulator.

===============================================================================
 Building and installing FaMouS
===============================================================================

We use premake4 to generate Makefiles, based on a premake4.lua script.

To clean and/or generate makefiles :

> premake4 clean
> premake4 gmake


To clean and/or build the simulator library:

> make [clean]

For a release (runs faster), or profiling, use
> make config=release [clean]
> make config=profile [clean]

To install the simulator :

> premake4 debpackage
> sudo dpkg -i libfamous-3.0.deb


===============================================================================
 Getting started
===============================================================================

To work with FaMouS, you can heavily rely on copy/paste, duplication and
modification of other material.

At https://github.com/AlexandreCampo/famous3Simulation, you will find a variety
of simulations using FaMouS that you can test, study, and hack.
